ðŸš¨ Feature requests created as an Issue will be closed.

Please note that my goal for this project is to keep it as lean as possible. I want anyone with a bit of coding knowledge to be able to read the codebase and fully understand everything it is doing.

Things that not be considered for this project are:

- Anything that modifies Immich or its files in any way. If it requires an API key or privileged accesss, it won't be considered as a new feature.
- Uploading photos (see above).
